# CSI-SQL-Task & Project

## Project Overview
During the summer internship at Celebal Technologies, I worked on a SQL project aimed at enhancing data management and retrieval processes for a specific client. The primary focus was to optimize database queries, improve data organization, and ensure efficient data retrieval.

## Objectives
1. **Optimize Database Queries**: Improve performance and reduce execution time.
2. **Improve Data Organization**: Enhance data integrity and reduce redundancy.
3. **Ensure Efficient Data Retrieval**: Implement indexing and other techniques for faster retrieval.

## Features Implemented
1. **Query Optimization**: Restructured complex SQL queries using indexing, query refactoring, and query plan analysis.
2. **Database Schema Refinement**: Normalized tables and redesigned schema layouts to improve data integrity.
3. **Indexing**: Created balanced indexes on frequently accessed columns to speed up performance.
4. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Developed procedures and functions to encapsulate complex business logic.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Primary language for database management.
- **DBMS**: Specific DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
- **SQL Profiler/Performance Tools**: Tools for monitoring and analyzing query performance.
